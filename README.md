# Website Code Refactoring

## Description

Refactoring (improving it without changing what it does) the existing code of a marketing agency's website to make it more accessible. Improving a website's accessibility allows for people with disabilities, that use assistive technologies like screen readers, video captions, and braille keyboards, to access and use the website, and navigate through it smoothly. A more acccessible website also ranks higher in search engine results that makes it more likely to be found by web users and so, is good for business. This small step also helps companies avoid discrimination and legal complaints.

In this project, this was done by modifying the HTML elements to their semantic counterparts, making sure that all links are working, and adding alternative text to illustrative images. The CSS component was also modified by consolidating selectors and properties and organising them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements.
