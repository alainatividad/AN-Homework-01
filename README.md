# Website Code Refactoring

## Description

Refactoring the existing code (improving it without changing what it does) for a marketing agency to make it more accessible.

Improving a website's accessibility allows for people with disabilities, using assistive technologies like screen readers, to access and navigate through a website smoothly.

This was done by modifying the HTML elements to their semantic counterparts, made sure that all links are working, added alternative text to illustrative images.

The CSS component was also modified by consolidating selectors and properties and organising them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements.
